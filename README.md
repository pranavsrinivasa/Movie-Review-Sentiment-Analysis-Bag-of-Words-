# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Bag of Words

This project delves into sentiment analysis on movie reviews using the Multinomial Naïve Bayes machine learning architecture, coupled with the Bag of Words approach. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive guide to the implementation.

## Project Overview

Movie Review Sentiment Analysis is a classic Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem, and this project tackles it with a Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier. The use of Bag of Words allows for the conversion of textual data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Multinomial Naïve Bayes:** Implements a probabilistic classifier known for its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks.

- **Bag of Words:** Utilizes a Bag of Words model to represent textual data, enabling the extraction of meaningful features for sentiment analysis.

## Learning Focus

This project serves as a fundamental learning step to understand NLP from scratch. By working with Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Bag of Words, users gain insights into the basics of sentiment analysis, feature representation in NLP, and the principles behind classifying textual data.
